<h1>Who We Are > <a  class="link" href="web.html">home</a></h1>  

<h1 id=wer2>Welcome to power store</h1>

<p>
    Welcome to my page, I’m sure you are wondering what this page is about and why does it have
     a name like power store it sounds weird right but what does it actually mean and what do we do.
</p>
      <p>
        The founder Mr. Amodu ore created this store to give weebs the power and ability to 
        feel welcomed and happy this page is dedicated to all things anime as you can see from the home page, the page was designed to make you feel at home.
      </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Amodu noticed that indeed most online stores don’t have things like cosplay, anime merch and so on and even if they do 
            it most times expensive so what did he do he decided to create a store that will sell quality anime stuffs at an affordable price so that people will have the power to afford it.
          </p>

               <P>
                He also sought to make it a place where by even if you are not shopping for anime merch you can also find some other things to do like, watch anime music videos, see anime rankings, talk about anime and interact with other weebs in our blog page which is in progress and even places where anime conventions are holding.
                 I hope I’ve been able to inform you about the page very well      
               </P>
